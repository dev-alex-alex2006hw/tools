rn socket readiness notification library.
Latest version available at http://kegel.com/rn

rn provides a more or less convenient wrapper around
two very efficient notification mechanisms, sigio and epoll.
See http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html for a description of these
two mechanisms.  Basically, they are standard Linux replacements
for poll that are much more efficient.
The right one to use is almost always epoll; sigio is only a fallback,
as it's less efficient.  rn picks the best one automatically for you
at runtime.

See rn.html for documentation, and rn_test.c for an example of how to use it.
