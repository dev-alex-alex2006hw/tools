	rn_sys_epoll.h uses poll.h rather than linux/poll.h, to compile properly with glibc-cvs's headers
	.h files do #include <> rather than #include ""
	Install rn_config.h so rn_*.h can use #ifdef HAVE_*
	Don't compile with -pedantic, since we use a C99 feature (varadic macros) in rn_dprint.h

0.3  10 Nov 2003
	Added configure script
	Doesn't assume sigio is always present or working (prelude to supporting kqueue)
	Renamed epoll.* to dev_epoll.*
	rn_prepare_fd_for_add now returns error code instead of exiting process (!)
	sys_epoll.c always sets the EPOLLET flag; should let us work with both
	old and new sys_epoll

	The generic rn_* macros have been replaced by function pointers; here's why:
	Turns out it's bad to make apps chose a notification method at compile time, 
	since there is in general no way to know which one will work until runtime.
	rn now uses elf magic to search for a working notification method
	at startup, and sets the function pointers to refer to that method.
	Apps which want to choose their own notification method can
	either call the new rn_config_*() setup functions themselves,
	or ignore the function pointers and call the familiar
	rn_{sigio,dev_epoll,sys_epoll}_*() routines directly.
