# the emulator configuration for node9
# uses a very minimal non-multimedia device set and strips out
# dis.  if i were enabling multimedia I'd create an devegl2 for graphics
# and use some highly portable audio library for devaudio.
#
# almost all devices will need at least minor patching to accomodate the
# libuv event model
#
# (if I were configuring a machine to run C programs I'd consider using either
#  raw plan9 or use pure libuv C threads, one for each functioning process and
#  force each user to have their own pgrp, egrp, fgrp).
#
# this is just the configuration model file.  node9 alpha uses a hand-configured 
# emu.c that reflects these settings and defines the global device table (devtab).
# (node9 beta will have functioning dynamic driver model loaders that load everything
# at startup.
# 
# note: the 'ndevs' value in emu.c is maximum number of devs,  devtab itself should be
# one larger than that value.  You should probably double its minimum size to allow for
# runtime loadable kernel modules for new devices. Make sure unused entries are set to nil
# and that the last entry is always nil as it marks the end of the devtab.
