tests.cpp contains unittests for C++ APIs. It uses Google Test for the unit
tests.  Note that the unit tests are only to test the functionality of OCApi.h.
It is not a system or end-to-end test.

Unit Test Requirements:

1. Install Google Test 1.7.0 on a Linux build machine to <gtest-1.7.0> from the
   following address:

	http://code.google.com/p/googletest/downloads/list

2. Create/Append a file named "local.properties" at <oic-resource>/csdk.
   "local.properties" is used by the build process to specify the path to the
   Google Test directory.

   local.properties should contain GTEST_DIR, as follows:

   GTEST_DIR := <gtest-1.7.0>

3. To run the unit test, first build the unit tests with the following command
   from <oic-resource>:

   make -f buildScript.mk linux_ub_unittests

4. Run the unit test by issuing the following command from <oic-resource>:

   ./unittests/tests
